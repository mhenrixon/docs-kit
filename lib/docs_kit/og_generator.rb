module DocsKit
  # Screenshots a URL into the site's OG/Twitter images. Loaded ONLY by the
  # host-installed `docs_kit:og` rake task (via an explicit require) — never at
  # gem runtime — so the headless-browser tooling it drives is never a docs-kit
  # dependency. zeitwerk ignores this file (see lib/docs_kit.rb) for the same
  # reason: it must not be eager-loaded into a host that never runs the task.
  #
  # Usage (from the rake task):
  #   DocsKit::OgGenerator.new(url:, out_dir:, sizes:, shooter:).call
  #
  # When #url is nil the generator boots the Rails app on an ephemeral port and
  # shoots "/"; when set it shoots that URL directly (e.g. a deployed site). The
  # shooter is a headless-browser CLI resolved at runtime: an explicit override,
  # else the first of shot-scraper / chromium / chrome found on PATH.
  class OgGenerator
    # Raised when no supported headless-browser CLI is available. The message
    # names each supported tool + how to install one, so the task fails with a
    # fix, not a stack trace.

    # (purpose-built, handles sizing cleanly); then a raw chromium/chrome.
