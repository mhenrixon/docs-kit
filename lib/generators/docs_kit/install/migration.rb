    # One ordered, versioned upgrade step between two docs-kit releases. `to` is
    # the version the migration belongs to (the release that introduced the
    # change); the registry runs it when a site's last-synced version is BELOW
    # `to`. The block receives the site's `(destination_root, generator)` so it
    # can read/rewrite files via the generator's helpers, and returns the list
    # of manual-cleanup warnings it could NOT safely automate.
    #
    # Warn-only-safe by contract (the #24 drift pattern): a migration does what
    # it can idempotently — never a destructive rewrite of a hand-edited line —
    # and hands back strings for whatever needs a human. A `nil` return means
    # "nothing to warn about".
